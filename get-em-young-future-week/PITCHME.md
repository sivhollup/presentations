@color[#034961](Educating for a digital future)

Note:
- Kintergardens have it right when it comes to teaching people stuff:  
- learning is fun
- learning is not dangerous
- you learn by failing
- you're never finished learning
- with current rate of advancement in techology and society, next generations
  will likely have to change jobs and domains several times
- speaking of how we enable people to switch jobs and the field in
  which they work, I have bone to pick with parts of our educational system. By
  example: 


---?image=https://images.pexels.com/photos/220301/pexels-photo-220301.jpeg&size=100%

Note: 
- mathematics, in particular applied maths, is taught with examples. 
- love examples, BUT something fundamental is missing: 
- explanations of concepts, what they mean and how to understand them
- students are given recipies for solving problems
- press so and so on the calculator
- to understand why this is a problem, we need to look at how we learn



---?image=http://thepeakperformancecenter.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Blooms-Revised.jpg&size=40%


Note: 
- Blooms taxonomy is a way to organise cognitive skills
- start learning at the bottom, work your way upwards
- the higher in the pyramid you are, the more you truly understand the subject
- the higher you are, the more creativity you need to employ
- in for instance applied mathematics, there is a tendency to dole out recipies
- that's tier one. 
- the problem is that this makes people into consumers
- consumers can use stuff, fex math calculators
- but without understanding you can't lever the tool that mathematics is
- you can't create


---

### Consumers are *not* the future


Note: 
- however, if you really understand a concept, a tool (whatever really), you can create
  new and interesting stuff and solve more interesting problems 
- in other words you become a producer 


---

### **Producers** are the future

Note: 
- producers are the ones who design the digital realm. Not necessarily
  developers, but people who understand the digital world
- we need to teach our kids about the digital realm and the tools that will
  enable them to achieve this understanding
- we need to encourage their creativity, because that is how we get
  groundbraking new discoveries
- How does this relate to programming? I bet you all thought this talk was about
  programming? 
- It is. It's about what programming really is, and what it's for
- Programming is almost the definition of being a producer, which is what we
  need for the future
- lets revisit blooms taxonomy in the context of programming



---?image=http://thepeakperformancecenter.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Blooms-Revised.jpg&size=40%

Note:
- remembering: getting the syntax right (so the computer can understand each
  line of code)
- understand: when to use which language feature
- apply: writing code
- analyse: why does my program give an error or unexpected output?
- evaluate: can I solve this problem in a better or different way? can I solve
  seemingly different problems in the same way?
- create: create a program that solves a problem, or one that solves another
  problem
- this is a good start. 
- this little exercise in using blooms taxonomy has a narrow definition of
  what programming is:

Note:
- lines of code. Text if you will, in the end 1s and 0s. 
- but we can think in a more abstract way about programming too


---?image=https://images.pexels.com/photos/957090/workshop-rustic-hammer-wrench-957090.jpeg

Note:
- a tool that lets us communicate our will to computers. 
- In order to be good at programming, you have to know how the tool works
- experiment with it
- play with it
- use it (get to the top of the pyramid)
- so yes, we need to teach kids programming and a lot of good things are
  happening with that
- Before we leave off programming as a tool: 


---?image=https://images.pexels.com/photos/709830/pexels-photo-709830.jpeg

Note:
- There are different kinds of tools, some more complex than others. Programming
  is more like a language than a hammer
- We need to get the basics right. Already now kids are starting to learn about
  basic control structures, like conditionals (choosing a or b depending on some
  condition being true or false), repetition (doing the same thing over and
  over), determinism and execution (same input gives same output EVERY time)
- there are a few more building blocks that are not taught much or discussed
  much yet:

@snapend
@snap[west]
## @color[#034961](Context)
@snapend

Note:
- assumptions and context are all around us all the time, but we rarely deal
  with them. The moment we go into the digital realm it hits us in the face. 
- assumptions: everything we take for granted
- language: what a word or phrase means
- context: the circumstances, or environment around an event, or
  statement, idea 
- in every context, we make assumptions
- context: making food, specifically pancakes 
- mix eggs, flour, salt, sugar, milk... 
- we also know we need just a little bit of salt, abit more sugar etc, roughly
  the same amount of flour and milk. 
- brings us to a different set of concepts:

## Comparison<br/>Sequences<br/>Equality
@snapend


Note:
- we compare and sort things all the time
- in maths it's nice and clean: greater than, less than, equal
- but in the real world, it quickly becomes hard
- when are things equal? when is an object larger than another?
- "our car is bigger than your car" (or cooler)
- is physical size the determining) factor? is it litres in the tank?
  Engine output? Context dependent
- These are basic building blocks. Pretty sure we can come up with good ways to
  teach this in accordance with blooms taxonomy (or similar)
- but there are several levels of complexity here, which we also need to address

## @color[#394A53](Problem solving)
@snapend

Note: 
- how to recognise the general and special concepts in a problem
- putting the building blocks together 
- which building blocks do we need?
- computational thinking (algorithmic thinking) and is a huge field
- the last concept we'll look at is something that has received more focus the
  last few years:

## Communication
@snapend

Note:
- how to communicate about the problems we solve
- this is surprisingly hard
- context and assumptions are different for everyone
- we think we have the same understanding of a problem, but we don't
- one reason for this is that natural languages are ambiguous in nature. 
- many words mean more or less the same, the same word can mean different things
- programming languages are, by definition, unambiguous. 
- one statement MUST only have one interpretation
- sadly this means you can't make puns in programming languages
- that programming languages are unambiguous has a huge implication: the digital
  realm is also unambiguous in nature. 
- still, we strive every day to represent an ambiguous, complex world in an
  unambiguous setting
- this fact is never taught or even discussed directly in any teaching material
  I've seen
- this talk is all about how we can prepare the next generations for the digital
  world, and I take that to mean that we have to be producers
- if we want to make the best producers (cuz it won't be enough just to be
  producers), if we want to master programming, 
- we need to address all these challenges in schools and universities. 
- in 10 or 15 years university level courses will be different than today

Note:
- we're just getting started on exploring the digital realm
- we will make a whole new generation of thinkers, tinkerers and explorers
- computational thinking and programming is a new field, we've only just started
  to walk (if that)
- we're only now starting to really interact with the digital universe
- not everyone will become programmers, but everyone will interact with the
  digital realm
- I want us to enable everyone to help explore this vast new universe and how it
  ties into the real world. Thank you.
