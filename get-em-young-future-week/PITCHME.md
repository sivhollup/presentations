# Get'em while they're young
### Educating for a digital future

Note:
- What is important when we teach children? 
- learning is fun
- learning is not dangerous
- you're never finished learning
- important last point: we know for sure that the next generation will most
  likely have to change jobs several times
- why? Society is evolving at a faster pace than ever, technology advancement is
  increasing
- this brings me to one of my pet peeves

Note: 
- mathematics, in particular for many in high school, is taught with examples. 
- love examples, BUT something fundamental is missing: 
- concepts, what they mean and how to understand them
- students are given recipies for solving problems
- press so and so on the calculator
- little or no explanation of what's really going on
- this makes people into consumers

### Consumers are not the future


Note: 
- consumers can use stuff, fex maths
- but without understanding you can't lever the tool that mathematics is
- if you really understand a concept, a tool (whatever really), you can create
  new and interesting stuff and solve more interesting problems 
- in other words:

### Producers are the future

Note: 
- we need to educate our children so that they thouroughly understand the tools
  they have
- we need to encourage their creativity, because that is how we get
  groundbraking new discoveries
- How does this relate to programming? I bet you all thought this talk was about
  programming? 
- It is. It's about what programming really is, and how we can educate our
  children to get the most out programming
- Why is this imporatant? Because programming is almost the definition of being
  a producer, which is what we need for the future

### So what is programming? 

Note:
- lines of code. Fine. Text if you will, in the end 1s and 0s. But what is it
  really?

Note:
- a tool. A tool that lets us communicate our will to computers. 
- In order to be good at programming, you have to know how the tool works
- experiment with it
- play with it
- use it
- so yes, we need to teach kids programming and a lot of good things are
  happening with that

Note:
- But. Programming is JUST a tool. We need to understand the fundamental
  concepts, the basics, because that enables us to understand programming in a
  better way. This has not really been taught to anyone. 
- what are the concepts, the building blocks?
