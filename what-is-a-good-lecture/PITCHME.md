### Relax, be creative, be efficient

Note: 
- right after I started working in private sector, event with Marco Elsafari
- gave a creative task with time limit, first one to get up when time was up got to perform
- I was the only one whose chair practically crashed down as I got up, was mortified
- newest employee, no one else got up. Didn't even hear the task completely
- absolutely mortified
- could have been extremely uncomfortable, but it wasn't, because of the atmosphere he created
- explanation: different personality traits react differently
- science? No idea. But it was the first time I was made to feel comfortable having a strong personality
- being comfortable in the situation you're in is extremely important
- I present quite abit, and the way he and many others present is inspiring, and I've learned about some mechanics of presenting

### A two-way conversation
@snapend

Note:
- picture: graph of tension vs interest over time
- First: two-way conversation, including lectures
- tension levels are high (both presenter and audience), interest level low (audience)
- as presenter: lower tension levels, increase interest and prepare audience
- picture from notes I made at course in presentation technique
- good tip right above the graph: look at TED videos and how the presenters introduce their talks!
- one way: personal story, like the one I just told
- doesn't even have to be related to the topic of presentation 
- added benefit: prepare audience for subject matter, let them have time to focus
- second: establish credentials: presenter should have correct competence 
- third: make topic relevant: what do the audience get out of the lecture? 
- why do these things? gain trust

### Trust
@snapend

Note:
- trust is the foundation of a good atmosphere
- Establish trust
- I want students to trust me
- I show myself both as a regular human being, with insecurities, and as a craftsperson with valuable experience
- also obtained by personal stories (for instance as the start of the lecture) such as the one I started with 
- other techniques: humor, enthusiasm, relevant stories, questions, admitting mistakes
- I show specifically that I am not perfect, so it's OK for them to not be perfect too
- why do I do this? I want my students to perform max, they can't do that if they're not relaxed
