### Relevance <br> Environment <br> Communication

Note:
- my favourite conference is the Booster Conference, local IT conference held every year by enthusiasts in the industry
- learn so much every year, on wide range of topics (you could all benefit from going there too!)
- key takeaway: communication is hard, we have to practice and evolve our skills all the time
- in order to fascilitate a good teaching environment, communication is the fundamental basis
- communication, environment and relevance: key elements to engaging students successfully over time   
- start with the most fundamental topic: communication

### @color[#1D1F20](Communication)
@snapend

Note:
- teaching situation has a skewed power balance
- teacher has much more power than a student has
- communication is hard in this setting for both parties
- first: establish communication and mutual respect
- second: maintain over time 
- work actively to narrow power balance 
- 1) I show myself as a human (admit mistakes, tell "secrets", acknowledge own unknown/uncertainty)
- must be balanced with "how did I overcome/what did I learn"
- spend time in the first few lectures (in particular first lecture) to let them get to know me a little
- 2) respect communication initiated by students: qs/comments, never ignore, take them all seriously, let them know why I won't/can't answer. This will prompt serious questions/comments because they know I will take them seriously 
- repeat that I don't ignore questions on purpose, repeat if I forget to answer
- 3) set the mood (create natural conversation setting) and teaching setting
- I am relaxed, in a good mood, focused on the students and the topic at hand
- look into camera (equivalent of eye contact) regularly
- took a course in presentation techniques/retoric that I use actively

### Deal with uncertainty

Note:
- 4) Address uncertainty specifically (repeatedly)
- I feel stupid large parts of the time in my work
- information overload is common, too many things I don't know (domain, tech stuff etc)
- students feel the same way, my colleagues feel the same way
- uncertainty and not knowing != stupid, but lack of (or differing)  context/experience
- no stupid questions/comments. Lack of experience/knowledge != stupid. 
- context is always unique, get everyone to the "right" context level to be efficient
- why bother with this? I want my students to perform to the best of their ability, must be relaxed in order to perform well mentally

### Teaching environment
@snapend

Note:
- too easy to reach cognitive overload
- humans can't focus on more than 5-7 concepts at once
- reduce mental load during teaching, not only of technical subjects, but use tech setup to make it easier as well

### Teaching environment
@snapend

Note:
- I establish how communication is to be done: q's by raising hand/speaking, in chat either publicly or DM, all of these are OK
- communicate mostly via chat: they type, I read aloud and answer, with some practice it flows naturally
- I release all my notes (detailed notes) on github, so they don't have to take notes
- slides help students remember context, simple design
- good microphone vital so they don't have to wonder what I'm saying

### Teaching environment
@snapend

Note:
- raised laptop, looking directly into camera rather than downwards into
- learned to use zoom (chat, screen sharing, toggling video etc)
- Microsoft whiteboard on Ipad to draw, upload pngs after lecture
- vary content: questions, tasks, discussions, coding demo, "regular" lecturing, try to break up at least every 20 minutes
- evaluation criteria ahead of compulsory assignments
- guest lectures (other voices/styles)

### Relevance

Note:
- outcome driven teaching: what can we achieve?
- when learning something new it's hard to see where it fits in the larger picture
- real life context: what can the concept we're discussing now be used for? How is it used?
- can I give an example in real life where this made a difference? What changed?
- use my professional experiences as much as possible
- always try to answer: what is the purpose of the topic?
- if practically possible:
- how is something done? Live coding and code examples to demonstrate how a technique is used
- show how I think and translate that into code
- show shortcuts and what kind of help the IDE can provide
- guest lectures (increase feeling of relevance and importance), also guest lectures can pour all their energy into making ONE good lecture (I help with setting correct context and level)
- correct subject level: repeat things they alreay should know (briefly) so that everyone has the correct context
- I take notes directly after each lecture: how did I do timewise? Any difficult subjects? Things I should change before next year? 
- try to improve a little at a time, also with presentation techniques
